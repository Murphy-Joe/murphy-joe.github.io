It's been a long time since Hue Jackson announced TJ Chapek as 2019’s champ! Welcome back for the 2021 reset.  For this year Holly has been granted maternity leave, making room for Andrew to test his mettle against grizzled League of Chaps veterans. 

Which brings us to this year's high-volume low-percentage draft recap.  A write up I provide for us to look back in 4 weeks and realize I have little to offer in terms of actual knowledge or opinions. So just know none of the following has any merit.  For each team I’ll briefly cover the following 5 categories:

``Forefathers``: IE your first 4 draft picks and what will likely be the foundation of your team

``Trend``: a thread that seemed to play out throughout your draft

``Reasons for hope``

``Reasons for worry``

``Favorite non-foundational player``

<br>

From 12 to 1, because it’s the only chance I get to be first. 

<br>

# 12. Joe - Cleveland Commodores
``Forefathers`` 
> Austin Ekeler, Stefon Diggs, Amari Cooper, Kyle Pitts

`Trend`
> Every single running back drafted is the same guy.  Austin Ekeler, Chase Edmonds, Travis Etienne, even the guy I picked up to replace Etienne - Jerrick McKinnon.  smaller pass catching Duke Johnson clones.  Shoulda played PPR. 

`Reasons for hope`
> There are a lot of young guys who “could” break out. (Like Travis Etie.. nevermind.)

`Reasons for worry`
>    The is only one guy on the team who had a productive year in 2020 - Diggs.  The rest could all be cases of unfounded hope. 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>    Seeing as I did not enjoy making any of the picks that were presented to me, I’ll go with Marquez ‘not Antonio’ Callaway in the hopes that his preseason week 2 magic meant something. 

<br>

# 11. Joey - JoeBro Sanson
`Forefathers`
> Saquon, Davante Adams, Darrel Henderson, Bobby Trees

`Trend`
> Doesn't care if a player's career year is likely behind him -- OBJ (system), Brady (how many retired QB's are still younger than Brady), Tyler Boyd (target competition), Davante (expecting A-Rod decline).  They're still good enough 

`Reasons for hope`
> The aformentioed players could still have a peak year in them, and the RB's all have high ceilings (Saquon, Henderson, Javonte Williams, Tony Pollard)

`Reasons for worry`
> ...Or they could all be mediocre. 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
> Free Tony Pollard!  If he gets a chance to take over for Zeke he'll become a household name. 

<br>

# 10. Garen - Scottish Hammers
`Forefathers`
>Aaron Jones, Jonathon Taylor, CeeDee Lamb, David Montgomery

`Trend`
>The autodraft `Trend` - Defense in the 9th, Kicker in the 10th, and a bunch of unemotional picks. 

`Reasons for hope`
>If the RB's all stay healthy (Aaron Jones, Jonathan Taylor, David Montgomery) they will easily carry this team to another playoff berth. 

`Reasons for worry`
>Not much, the rest of the squad easily fills in around the RBs (Dak / Burrow at QB, CeeDee / Golladay / Who Cares at WR)

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>None, they're all smart, unsexy picks. 

<br>


# 9. Nate - Oglebay Fighting Elk
`Forefathers`
>Travis Kelce, DeAndre Hopkins, Cooper Kupp, Josh Jacobs

`Trend`
>Per Nate's usual approach, he targeted good players who are only mildly appreciated when they should be wildly appreciated

`Reasons for hope`
>His underappreciated players do have circumstances to rise above though, Josh Jacobs and Ronald Jones (talent but enough opportunity?), Myles Gaskin (opportunity but enough talent?), Jerry Jeudy and Jaylen Waddle (can they overcome average QBs?).  The hope is the answers are yes. 

`Reasons for worry`
>These fear that the talent and opportunity don't meet. 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Waddle feels like he's going to have one of those OBJ type rookie years.  Reminder: This is an opinion based on absolutely nothing. 

<br>


# 8. Matt - Country Roads Takes Mahomes
`Forefathers`
>Mahomes / Lamar, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Keenan Allen

`Trend`
>Takes two of all the players you only need one of.  2 QBs, 2 Defenses, 2 Kickers.  Did have the willpower to only take 1 TE, riding the ol' Evan Engram crapshoot. 

`Reasons for hope`
>It's a great year to own the KC QB/RB battery between Mahomes and CEH.  Bold statement to predict Mahomes' success, what can I say.  But the internet people tell me KC's offensive line is stacked this year.  Side note: two of those linemen might be injured for week 1 vs the Browns, fingers crossed. 

`Reasons for worry`
>If he can't turn one of his two stud QB's into an RB, he's a little thin there ..after CEH it's down to Damien Harris (one of 16 Patriot running backs) and Wayne Gallman (who literally wasn't worth starting when he was starting - per a salty former owner)

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Wayne Gallman. Just kidding. Chase Claypool is a monster, and Antonio Brown is an injury away from being Mike Evans or Chris Godwin. 

<br>


# 7. Kevin - The Fields of Dreams
`Forefathers`
>TyFreak, Antonio Gibson, Chris Carson, Josh Allen

`Trend`
>Kevin got the value, or just the exact guy I would have taken, to fall to him all draft long

`Reasons for hope`
>If Antonio Gibson and Chris Carson actually hold down their bellcow roles, this team might run the table.

`Reasons for worry`
>Their are some ifs, even if I'm on the optimistic side of many of these players.  Tee Higgins needs a healthy Burrow and an O-Line to keep him that way.  Higbee needs to extrapolate his stats from half playing time to full playing time now that he gets his shot. Mostert needs to stay healthy to get at least half the SF carries. Devonta Smith needs Jalen Hurts to be decent.  James Conner should be able to overtake my guy Chase Edmonds.   Wait, this was suppose to be the reasons to worry section. 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Higbee and Mostert are the guys I expect to be nothing but studs. 

<br>


# 6. Jim - Atomic Sloth
`Forefathers`
>Derrick Henry, Najee Harris, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin

`Trend`
>Jim's main draft `Trend` was expending 90% of his efforts blocking out the wild party at Melinda's and the remaining 10% crossing off players who had been selected.  With 0% left when it came time for his actual pick he did well to select a lot of high volume workhorses.

`Reasons for hope`
>The high volume guys would include both Tampa WR's (Evans and Godwin), both top RB's (Henry and Harris), and now his 3rd RB James Robinson no longer has Travis Etienne to split time with.  Even his QB Kyler Murray tends to get more plays than anyone else in the NFL thanks to Kliff Kingsbury's uptempo demands.  

`Reasons for worry`
>None really.  This team is solid all if not stacked everywhere.  Howeverrrr, with the two Tampa wideouts, there's a lot resting on Tom Brady's arm.  And what has Tom Brady's arm actually done lately other than win its 7th Super Bowl? 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Kyler feels like everything is going to culminate for him this season. 

<br>

# 5. Daniel - Chubble in Paradise
`Forefathers`
>Chubb, Justin Jefferson, George Kittle, Miles Sanders

`Trend`
>Daniel trends towards the young guys and tries to be ahead of the prime curve

`Reasons for hope`
>A lot of Daniel's players have a chance to 'emerge' this year.  Matt Stafford (now paired with Sean McVay), Diontae Johnson (another year towards what looks like will be a superstar peak), Henry Ruggs and Trevor Lawrence (both with raw talent that may or may not be refined enough for NFL consistency yet)

`Reasons for worry`
>Many of Daniels players are in somewhat 2nd fiddle situations on not great teams.  Miles Sanders seems to always have to defer to Jordan Howard or even Boston friggin Scott. Diontae Johnson has to share Roethlisbergers ducks with Claypool. DJ Chark has a rookie QB and apparently this Leviska Shenault guy is a good WR over there too?  Jarvis is great but the Browns won't be force feeding anyone not named Chubb (oh look Daniel's in luck).

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>I like Irv Smith to do well with his new full time role in Minnesota this year, but lets talk about Diontae Johnson and Pittsburgh WRs history for a second.  

    
    Please excuse this sidebar Daniel.  Ever since I've been playing fantasy football, Pittsburgh has ALWAYS had two simultaneously great wide receivers.  And they don't even try to draft them.  Allow me to drag you through 20 years in memory lane.  

`01-05` Heinz Ward and Plaxico Burress. The OG's. 

`04`
Big Ben comes in to play as a rookie and Heinz Ward is pissed.  Back when I was young rookie QB's were guaranteed to suck.  That started to change around the time Roethlisberger stepped on the field.  Roethlisberger had one trick; it was to look to one side of the field he wasn't going to throw to, and then just throw it to wherever Heinz Ward was.  Worked. 

`06-09`
Heinz Ward and Santonio Holmes.  Yes, thanks Pittsburgh for realizing Ohio State players are awesome and ruining them for the kind folks here in Cleveland. (Baltimore does this too, on top of actually stealing our football team)

`10-11`
Heinz Ward, Mike Wallace (84th pick), Antonio Brown (195th pick).  Are you serious?  Heinz Ward is finally slowing down, but Mike Wallace comes in to run around like he's Josh Gordon.  Meanwhile Antonio Brown keeps making big plays and no one notices for a couple years.

`12`
Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown.  No big deal, just heavyweights Mike Tyson and Antonio Tarver in their prime. 

`13`
Antonio Brown and Emmanuel Sanders (82nd pick). Browns fans: Thank God Mike Wallace got signed away in free agency.  Wait, Emmanuel Sanders is good? wut.

`14`
Antonio Brown.  The EXCEPTION. in 2014 the second WR was Markus Wheaton.

`15-17`
Antonio Brown and Martavius Bryant (118th pick).  Martavius Bryant threatened to be what Chase Claypool is today, and he often was, but was equally as often suspended.

`18`
Antonio Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster (62nd pick).  A guy named JuJu.  A small slot reciever forced to play on the outside.  Whatever, 111 catches and 1400 yards.  

`19`
Finally, Antonio Brown is GIVEN away to the Raiders while still in his prime. He gets a $30M signing bonus, and then repeatedly pulls the strangest publicity stunts ever seen to get released and lose his $30M bonus.  Only to be picked up by the Patriots with a $10M signing bonus.  Only to lose that and get re-released due to a sexual assault accusation.  In total that year AB went from $30M to $10M to $0.1M  Never forget. 

`19`
Oh ya, meanwhile the Steelers now have JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson (66th pick). 

`20-21`
JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson, Chase Claypool.   STACKED. AS. EVER. 


<br>

# 4. TJ - Passless Chaps
`Forefathers`
>Alvin Kamara, Calvin Ridley, ~~JK Dobbins~~, Julio Jones

`Trend`
>TJ picks who he knows, Atlanta players and former OSU studs. 

`Reasons for hope`
>Mike Davis, Curtis Samuel, Kenyan Drake, Brandon Cooks - this is the year it happens!

`Reasons for worry`
>Mike Davis, Curtis Samuel, Kenyan Drake, Brandon Cooks - this is not the year it happens.

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Getting Mike Davis at 69th overall was a steal. Mostly by virtue of no one to challenge him for carries.  Coradelle Patterson is listed as his backup.  ...the wide receiver Coradelle Patterson.  When Mike Davis was still there at my 60th pick I felt like he had already dropped way too far, but Travis Etienne had a worse team, more competition, and most importantly a less generic name so naturally I passed on Mr Davis.

`Condolences`
>To all JK Dobbins owners. Unfair.  I was at a draft yersterday where someone owned JK for all of 3 hours.    

<br>

# 3. Andrew - Berger
`Forefathers`
>Zeke, AJ Brown, Allen Robinson, D'Andre Swift

`Trend`
>Again the autodraft strikes with a Defense in the 9th round, a Kicker in the 10th, and unemotional smart picks.  To Andrew's credit he was in another city attending a concert with his boys.  

`Reasons for hope`
>#1 reason is the autodraft's track record of domination.  #2 Nabbed both exciting SF wide receivers Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel (at 94!)

`Reasons for worry`
>With 4 good WR's to start every week he'll only need 2 RBs.  The only weak link is at Tight End where the choices are Robert Tonyan or Anthony Firkser. 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Alexander Mattison.  Minnesota is a rare team that will use a running back as a full time workhorse.  Dalvin has been that guy, but Mattison is basically his clone if he goes down. 

<br>


# 2. Tony - TMagic
`Forefathers`
>Dalvin Cook, Joe Mixon, McLaurin F1, DJ Moore

`Trend`
>Mock draft master by the moniker of TMagic looks like he knew who he wanted all the way through the end of the draft.  Tony's out to prove his first year success was no fluke. 

`Reasons for hope`
>Nearly everyone of Tony's guys has a worst case scenario of above average to a best case scenario of absolute breakout.
    Mixon has always had the potential.  McLaurin now gets a strong armed and willing QB to match his speed.  DJ Moore is about to get an enormous target percentage. Trey Sermon landed in the friendliest system for running backs in the NFL.  Justin Herbert is aiming to be on the Mahomes, Lamar, and Josh Allen level.  Even Corey Davis has a chance to finally cash in on his long lost promise. 

`Reasons for worry`
>Tony's team will be good, the only question is will it be great.  The worry is some of these guys will need to play beyond their current expectations for that to happen.   Fournette did that last year, will he again? Similar wonders for Michael Gallup (thinking of his strong 2019 with Dak) and TJ Hockenson (going from a good 2020 with Stafford to Jared Goff)

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>Trey Sermon.  Especially with Mostert's propensity to be injured. 

<br>

# 1. Melinda - Peppa Pigskins
`Forefathers`
>Chistian McCaffrey, DK Metcalf, Darren Waller, Tyler Lockett

`Trend`
>Melinda celebrated her 1.01 slot by hosting 2021's epic draft party. And rightfully so because 1.01 was without a doubt the best draft slot this year.

`Reasons for hope`
>Melinda scored massive value every time she got to pick at the end of a round. 
    For example: here's the WR's taken in order in round 2 (pk 24): 
    
    Stefon Diggs
    Davante Adams
    Deandre Hopkins
    Justin Jefferson
    Calvin Ridley
    AJ Brown 
    DK Metcalf  
    
>They're basically all equal value, except Melinda got to pair one with the top RB Christian McCaffrey from round 1 (pk 1). 
    Just because I'm jealous I'll go to the annyoing lengths of showing the same thing happened in round 4 (pk 48):

    Robert Woods
    Chris Godwin
    Julio Jones
    DJ Moore
    Tyler Lockett 
>These guys also could have been taken in any order of equivalence, but Melinda got to pair one with the top (non-Kelce) TE Darren Waller from round 3 (pk 25). 


    Late Addendum: Melinda reaps the JK Dobbins misfortunes with Gus Edwards stepping in to give her a rock solid starting roster.  Look out!

`Reasons for worry`
>The #1 variable that will decide her future is now Russell Wilson's health.  Much like Jim who owns both TB wideouts, and Andrew who owns both SF wideouts, Melinda owns Seattle's top 2 wideouts.  However I think the difference between Russ and his backup is far greater than the dropoff from SF's Garropollo or TB's Tom Brady (at his current age). 

`Favorite non-foundational player`
>The guys after round 4 all super volatile, a case could be made they'll have a career year as easily as the possibility of approximately zero points (thinking JuJu Smith-Schuster, Will Fuller, Noah Fant, Michael Pittman Jr, AJ Dillon).  
    But AJ Dillon has the best what if scenario in the case of an Aaron Jones injury.  RB1 upside. 


<br>

I wish best of luck, no injuries, and 1st place finishes to all of you.
